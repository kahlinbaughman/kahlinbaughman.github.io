# Why a guide?

You may be asking why I am making a guide for making a static website using Jekyll. Normally, I wouldn't do such a thing, especially with something that is considered a simple and easy. However, while setting it up was easy, installing and using a theme of my choice was a complete pain. Required a couple hours of googling, frustration, and patience. I decided for my first post, I would give a guide in hopes that if someone is like me, they can avoid the hours of frustration.
